# Helix Config
Configuration file for Helix text editor

## Install

Just copy the config.toml file in ~/.config/helix


## Autocompletion

For autocompletion to work you must have the LSP (Language Server Protocol) of the language you are using.

For example if you are using Rust, you must have the rust-analyzer installed through:

```bash
rustup component add rust-analyzer
```
